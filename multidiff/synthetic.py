    Compute theoretical concentration profiles, given the diffusion matrix and

    Parameters
    ----------

    diff_matrix : tuple
        tuple of eigenvalues and eigenvectors

    x_points : list of arrays
        points at which profiles are measured. There are as many profiles as
        exchange vectors.

    exchange_vectors : array
        array where each column encodes the species that are exchanged in the
        diffusion experiment. There are as many columns as diffusion
        experiments.

    noise_level : float
        Gaussian noise can be added to the theoretical profiles, in order to
        simulation experimental noise.
